### Generator Control-Flow

Support for generators, a special case of Iterators where the control flow can be paused and resumed, in order to support asynchronous programming in the style of "co-routines" in combination with Promises (see below). [Notice: the generic async function usually is provided by a reusable library and given here just for better understanding. See co or Bluebird's coroutine in practice.]
